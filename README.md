The App.ipynb notebook creates a functioning simple web application that could be used for monitoring customer satisfaction.
The application consists of three screens and allows users to enter reviews, which are saved in an SQLite database. 
It also enables the display of all reviews in a tabular form from the SQLite database and provides an overview of key phrases used in the review text in the form of a word cloud.

The application is built using Flask and ngrok tools. The script has been configured to run on Google Colab.
